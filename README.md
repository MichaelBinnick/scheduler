# Interview Scheduler

## Overview

Interview Scheduler is a fullstack, single-page web application that allows you to book and manage appointments from 12pm - 5pm on any weekday.

The appointments data persists to a database managed by a separate server application, using a RESTful API system.

This fullstack web application was built primarily using React.js, using a TDD approach utilizing the Jest and Cypress testing suites to implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
